# Low Energy Messenger

Low Energy Messenger is an instant messaging Web App (also for Firefox OS) that pays very high attention to battery status.

It has originally been developed for [this MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Developing/gather_and_modify_data/retrieving_battery_status_information) that looks at one way to manage energy consumption: The Battery Status API.

The demo is published [here](http://www.francesco.iovine.name/mdn/low-energy-messenger/public_html/) ([short link](http://goo.gl/87QanF))

## Notes

Low Energy Messenger has the following features:

- A battery status bar, containing battery status information
- A chat section, containing all the messages received or sent
- An action bar, containing a text field, a button to send a message, a button to take a photo and a button to install the app on Firefox OS

The app doesnâ€™t allow users to take photos when the battery level is low or the device is not charging. It has been made using HTML + CSS + Javascript, with no libs and using static data, so no web services on Internet, but real integration with the Battery Status API and a realistic look & feel.

## Project Setup

No setup is needed.
